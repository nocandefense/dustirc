# Dust IRC VS Code Extension – Work Breakdown Structure

## Level 1 – Project Phases
1. Project Management
2. Protocol Foundations
3. Connection & Negotiation Layer
4. Authentication & Capability Features
5. VS Code Integration & UI
6. Testing & Quality Assurance
7. Observability & Tooling
8. Documentation & Release Management
9. Post-Release & Continuous Improvement

## Level 2 & 3 – Detailed Tasks

### 1. Project Management
1.1 Establish charter, success metrics, and schedule baseline  
1.2 Configure productivity tools (repo hygiene, WeKan board, automation scripts)  
1.3 Weekly planning, standup logging, and backlog grooming  
1.4 Weekly retrospectives and risk/issue log maintenance  
1.5 Monthly roadmap and ADR review

### 2. Protocol Foundations
2.1 Evaluate existing IRC client libraries vs custom implementation  
2.2 Spike on transport requirements (TLS, reconnect policies, rate limits)  
2.3 Capture and annotate representative IRC transcripts (legacy + modern servers)  
2.4 Define capability support matrix and feature flags  
2.5 Update ADRs with protocol decisions and roadmap

### 3. Connection & Negotiation Layer
3.1 Implement socket management, lifecycle hooks, and reconnect strategy  
3.2 Build CAP negotiation flow with capability discovery  
3.3 Handle legacy servers without CAP support  
3.4 Implement diagnostic logging around connection stages  
3.5 Create error handling/reporting pathways for connection failures

### 4. Authentication & Capability Features
4.1 Implement SASL PLAIN auth flow and credential storage strategy  
4.2 Integrate account-tag handling in message pipeline  
4.3 Add away-notify support and state synchronization  
4.4 Implement server-time processing and timestamp normalization  
4.5 Wire message-tags into downstream consumers (UI, logging)  
4.6 Document fallback behavior when capabilities are refused

### 5. VS Code Integration & UI
5.1 Set up extension activation, configuration surface, and dependency wiring  
5.2 Build status bar, notifications, and error surfaces  
5.3 Develop channel list/tree view with join/part actions  
5.4 Implement message timeline rendering and command input  
5.5 Add command palette actions and keyboard shortcuts  
5.6 Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, contrast, screen reader labels)

### 6. Testing & Quality Assurance
6.1 Author unit tests for message parsing, state transitions, and reducers  
6.2 Build mock IRC server harness for integration tests  
6.3 Script test scenarios (happy path, capability declines, legacy server)  
6.4 Configure automated lint, type-check, and test pipelines  
6.5 Execute manual smoke checklist per milestone and log results

### 7. Observability & Tooling
7.1 Introduce structured logging with configurable verbosity  
7.2 Create developer console/debug view within the extension  
7.3 Add telemetry toggle and privacy-safe event definitions  
7.4 Build log export/share workflow for support cases  
7.5 Profile performance and memory footprint; address hotspots

### 8. Documentation & Release Management
8.1 Draft install/configuration guide and capability matrix  
8.2 Produce troubleshooting guide and FAQ  
8.3 Document development workflows (test harness usage, logging)  
8.4 Prepare marketplace assets (README, changelog, icon baseline)  
8.5 Package extension, tag release, and maintain version history

### 9. Post-Release & Continuous Improvement
9.1 Collect feedback and support issues from preview release  
9.2 Update backlog with optional IRCv3 capabilities and enhancements  
9.3 Schedule maintenance tasks (dependency updates, certificate support)  
9.4 Review telemetry/logs for emergent issues  
9.5 Capture lessons learned and refresh roadmap for next cycle
